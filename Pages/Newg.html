<p class="nhead2" align="left">Updated: Dec 8, 2017, 05.34PM IST</p>
<p class="nhead1"> Google might be planning to try its luck in the console market with subscription-based gaming. The search giant, which is not quite successful in the smartphone, tablet or speaker industry for now, could soon be locking horns with Microsoft and Sony as the duo are major players in the particular field. By extension it may also be going against Apple, Nintendo and Amazon.The firm is trying to make this happen by making the subscription-based gaming service available via its Chromecast supporting devices, says The Information. The firm could also be working on a hardware component as well. </div>

<p class="nhead"><b>20 years of GTA: The series that reigns supreme</b></p>
<p class="nhead2" align="left">Updated: Oct 8, 2017, 11.11AM IST</p>
<p class="nhead1">
Twenty years ago this month Grand Theft Auto or better known as GTA was released for the first time. It wouldn't be an exaggeration to say that action- adventure games have never been the same since then. GTA had the perfect mix of spectacular and simplicity - one of the reasons why the game still remains widely popular. It had all the elements which a gamer looks for into a game: challenging, replayable and, of course, memorable. The latest version of the game - GTA V - has sold more than 80 million copies and remains the number one video game in the UK.
It was first released for PC, PlayStation and GameBoy in October 1997. The first version of the game was set across three fictional cities in the US. Such was the impact that many outlets called for an outright ban of the game as it was percieved to be too violent. As a player you had to choose a mission to progress and GTA had everything - from car chase, racing, underworld characters - that makes a game exciting to play.
